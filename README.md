### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rachael, a trainee junior frontend developer with experience with these languages and tools:

â€¢	HTML5 (semantic
â€¢	CSS3
â€¢	JavaScript
â€¢	React
â€¢	Visual Studio

Iâ€™m passionate about writing clean code and creating user-friendly experiences online.

ðŸŒ±Iâ€™m currently learning about advanced JavaScript features and continue to brush up on React. 
ðŸŒ±I also have a few topics on my â€˜To Learnâ€™ list including SASS, jQuery, and PHP.

When Iâ€™m not coding you can find me playing console and tabletop games, out on walks, or with my nose in a book.ðŸ˜„
